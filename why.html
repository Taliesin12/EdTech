    <h2>Interface</h2>
    <h3>When a student graduates from the new model of education they will have a unique knowledge tree that shows exactly their skills. </h3>
    <h2>The New American University</h2>
    <h3>ASU is not looking to measure itself by exclusivity. It is looking to measure itself on success.</h3>
    <h2>Having real Proof of your skills</h2>
    <h3>every system that works has a feed back loop.</h3>
    <h3>examples of this working today (find examples of edtech working to improve. I am sure they will have it easily accessible)</h3>

    <h5>WHy am I communicating this by website?</h5>
    <h6>Websites are the form of communication that we use every day, and more closely matches how our brains work. Concepts that are seeming unlinked are able to be linked. Every other form of communication except for a conversation must be consumed lineraly. A website is interactive and you can find your own path that brings you to your goal. </h6>

    <div class="box">
      <h1>Philosophy</h1>
      <h2>This website isn't about "wow look at this cool thing"</h2>
      <h2>It isnt about the educational industry</h2>
      <h2>It is about the Children</h2>
      <h2>It is about improving their lives. </h2>
      <h2>It is education that hasnt fogotten its purpose. To improve lives</h2>
      <h2>To awaken the Joy of learning</h2>
      <h2>One of the greatest crimes is that the education system has taught some people they are dumb and cant learn when in actuality they were just taught poorly</h2>
      <h3>I not aware of ever having met anyone that doesnt like to learn. The Brain is a Hungry organ and wants to learn. It is just what ever they want to learn about. I have met people that think they are dumb and bad at math but are able to instinctually multiply by sixes and sevens because of their love for football. That person was able to talk about historical facts by the multitude. That person understands team dynamics and strategy better than people just out of their MBA. </h3>
      <h3>A young girl that is very social is able to understand communication of human interactions that take a phd to truely define. A Evolutionary Biologist will be able to tell you in great detail about the mating rituals and courtship of some strange exotic animal but not be able to do the same for humans. She is able to tell in fine detail the etiquite and communication of modern day humans as well as the communication of their clothing.</h3>
      <h2>The only difference between some of the  understanding and skills between these and PHD's is the way they communicate. You could say something in the terms of common colloquial language and it isn't as trusted as the same information would be in a thesis. </h2>
      <h2>This is just a transposing of the arrogance of Higher education. It is a new version of the attiude that "only people that speak latin could really qualify as intelligent"</h2>
