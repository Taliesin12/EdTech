    <h1>The Potential of EdTech</h1>
    <h2>Time</h2>
      <h3>You can go on vacation whenever you  want</h3>
      <h4>because the lessons are individalized and the time is variable students will be able to miss time from school and have no negative consequences.</h4>
      <h3>No Homework</h3>
      <h4>Because the students time will be more productive during school hours, they wont need to do extra learning at home, and at the very least the parent wont need to be the one doing all the teaching. </h4>
    <h3>Student</h3>
    <h3>Teacher</h3>
      <h4>Teachers will be better able to do the things that they loved about their job. less time spent grading and more time actually teaching. </h4>
    <h3>Parents</h3>
      <h4>Parents will be able to see how well their student is learning different topics and wont need to be tasked with helping them learn their work. </h4>
    <h1>What is preventing EdTech from reaching its potential</h1>
    <h2>The Current system</h2>
    <h2>The Politicazation of Educaiton</h2>
    <h1>How to remove the road blocks of EdTech</h1>
    <h2>Asu</h2>

    <h3>Companies will be getting employees that fit better</h3>
    <h4>Companies will be able to make a profile for what kind of employee they need and the necessary qualifications. an algorithm will match their profile with the people in the database that are looking for jobs. Also someone will be able to see all the jobs they currently qualified for, closely qualified for, and what gaps they have between your current qualifications and your dream job.</h4>
    <h3>Each student in the U.S will get an individualized education</h3>
    <h4>Education is not a one size fits all scenario. Each student learns in different ways and with enough content and advanced enough algorithms students will be able get each lesson tailored to their learning style. </h4>

    <h2>The education system today is failing</h2>
    <h3>The Failing of the education is not caused by teachers, students, or parents.</h3>
    <h2>EdTech is able to take care of alot of those failings</h2>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <h4>Students</h4>
    <h5>Students wouldn't need to spend time in class listening to a lecture they already know</h5>
    <h5>Students wouldnt be assigned homework they already understand at the expense of the homework they don't understand</h5>
    <h4>Teachers</h4>
    <h5>Teachers would be able to truely see where their time should be spent because they could see exactly where their students are struggling</h5>
    <h5>Any assignments given over electronics would graded allowing teachers to spend their time better preparing for the students</h5>
    <h4>Parents</h4>
    <h5>Parents could see exactly where their children are learning, what their learning style is and how to help them</h5>
    <h5>Parents wont need to spend as much time helping their child with homework, because it will already be more efficent</h5>
    <h5>Because the student is learning at their own pace instead of as one of a batch of students they can be called away for any reason and not interrupt their learning</h5>
    <h4>Administration</h4>
    <h5>Adminsistration will be able to see exactly how a student learns and match them more effectively with how a teacher teaches</h5>
    <h4>Companies and Employes</h4>
    <h5>Companies will be able to make a profile about the specific skills they require for a job opening. prospective employees will have their profile of the skills they have</h5>
    <h5>This will save time for companies to find the right employees, and employees to find the jobs they are qualified for.</h5>
    <h3>Quality</h3>
    <h4>Because time is the variable and not quality, the education of the student will be a higher quality and will be able to show that</h4>
