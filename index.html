    <h2>When ever we go from one organization to another there is an interface. from one school to another school because the family moved. from High School to University or trade school. From University or trade school to company. All of these have had one organization tell the other organization where the individual in question is in their understanding and skills. Because of the complex nature of this undertaking and the number of individuals involved these have had to rely on simple standards that can be easily understood and compared. This has proven to have drawbacks but we accepted it at first because it was the best we could do, then because it would be to dificult to change, than because it had so much time behind it that no one questioned it.</h2>
    <h2>In this day and age we can do much more than could be done before. And also we are frustrated with the limitations of the current system. </h2>
    <h1>The point of this website is to adequately communicate why we need to use a new method of measureing students knowledge. And how to get one to actually be implemented in todays society.</h1>
    <h2>The education system today is failing</h2>
    <h3>The Failing of the education is not caused by teachers, students, or parents.</h3>
    <h2>EdTech is able to take care of alot of those failings</h2>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <h4>Students</h4>
    <h5>Students wouldn't need to spend time in class listening to a lecture they already know</h5>
    <h5>Students wouldnt be assigned homework they already understand at the expense of the homework they don't understand</h5>
    <h4>Teachers</h4>
    <h5>Teachers would be able to truely see where their time should be spent because they could see exactly where their students are struggling</h5>
    <h5>Any assignments given over electronics would graded allowing teachers to spend their time better preparing for the students</h5>
    <h4>Parents</h4>
    <h5>Parents could see exactly where their children are learning, what their learning style is and how to help them</h5>
    <h5>Parents wont need to spend as much time helping their child with homework, because it will already be more efficent</h5>
    <h5>Because the student is learning at their own pace instead of as one of a batch of students they can be called away for any reason and not interrupt their learning</h5>
    <h4>Administration</h4>
    <h5>Adminsistration will be able to see exactly how a student learns and match them more effectively with how a teacher teaches</h5>
    <h4>Companies and Employes</h4>
    <h5>Companies will be able to make a profile about the specific skills they require for a job opening. prospective employees will have their profile of the skills they have</h5>
    <h5>This will save time for companies to find the right employees, and employees to find the jobs they are qualified for.</h5>
    <h3>Quality</h3>
    <h4>Because time is the variable and not quality, the education of the student will be a higher quality and will be able to show that</h4>
    <h3>Concerns</h3>
    <h4>Screen time/technopani</h4>
    <h5>people have always been afraid of the quality of learning going down when communication advances</h5>
    <h6>Socarates thought writing would undermine our minds</h6>
    <h6>The printing press would make "a confusing and harmful amount of books"</h6>
    <h6>Newspapers would ruin the spirituality of people because they wouldnt get their news from the pulpit.</h6>
    <h6>The invention of the telephone would ruin face-to-face communication.</h6>
    <h5>People are always nervous when technology is introduced into the world and so far all of those downsides, if indeed real, are greatly out weighed by the benefits.</h5>
    <h2>EdTech is not able plug into the current system adequately.</h2>
    <h2>An industry is either limited or liberated by its industrial standards.</h2>
    <h3>Education does have industrial standards</h3>
    <h4>ABCDF</h4>
    <h4>GPA</h4>
    <h4>Diploma</h4>
    <h2>A better system would be able to allow the potential of EdTech to grow.</h2>
