    <h1>The point of this website is to adequately communicate why we need to use a new method of measureing students knowledge.</h1>
    <h2>The education system today is failing</h2>
    <h2>EdTech is able to take care of alot of those failings</h2>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <h4>Students</h4>
    <h5>Students wouldn't need to spend time in class listening to a lecture they already know</h5>
    <h5>Students wouldnt be assigned homework they already understand at the expense of the homework they don't understand</h5>
    <h4>Teachers</h4>
    <h5>Teachers would be able to truely see where their time should be spent because they could see exactly where their students are struggling</h5>
    <h5>Any assignments given over electronics would graded allowing teachers to spend their time better preparing for the students</h5>
    <h4>Parents</h4>
    <h5>Parents could see exactly where their children are learning, what their learning style is and how to help them</h5>
    <h5>Parents wont need to spend as much time helping their child with homework, because it will already be more efficent</h5>
    <h4>Administration</h4>
    <h5>Adminsistration will be able to see exactly how a student learns and match them more effectively with how a teacher teaches</h5>
    <h4>Companies and Employes</h4>
    <h5>Companies will be able to make a profile about the specific skills they require for a job opening. prospective employees will have their profile of the skills they have</h5>
    <h5>This will save time for companies to find the right employees, and employees to find the jobs they are qualified for.</h5>
    <h3>Quality</h3>
    <h4>Because time is the variable and not quality, the education of the student will be a higher quality and will be able to show that</h4>
    <h3>Concerns</h3>
    <h4>Screen time/technopani</h4>
    <h5>people have always been afraid of the quality of learning going down when communication advances</h5>
    <h6>Socarates thought writing would undermine our minds</h6>
    <h6>The printing press would make "a confusing and harmful amount of books"</h6>
    <h6>Newspapers would ruin the spirituality of people because they wouldnt get their news from the pulpit.</h6>
    <h6>The invention of the telephone would ruin face-to-face communication.</h6>
    <h5>People are always nervous when technology is introduced into the world and so far all of those downsides, if indeed real, are greatly out weighed by the benefits.</h5>
    <h2>EdTech is not able plug into the current system adequately.</h2>
    <h2>An industry is either limited or liberated by its industrial standards.</h2>
    <h3>Education does have industrial standards</h3>
    <h4>ABCDF</h4>
    <h4>GPA</h4>
    <h4>Diploma</h4>
    <h2>A better system would be able to allow</h2>
